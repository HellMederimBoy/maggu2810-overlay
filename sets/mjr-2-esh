# Change npm's default directory to another directory
# 
# There are times when you do not want to change ownership of the default directory that npm uses (i.e. /usr) as this could cause some problems, for example if you are sharing the system with other users.
#
# Instead, you can configure npm to use a different directory altogether. In our case, this will be a hidden directory in our home folder.
# 
# Make a directory for global installations:
#     mkdir ~/.npm-global
# Configure npm to use the new directory path:
#     npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
# Open or create a ~/.profile file and add this line:
#     export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
# Back on the command line, update your system variables:
#     source ~/.profile
# Test: Download a package globally without using sudo.
#     npm install -g jshint
# Instead of steps 2-4 you can also use the corresponding ENV variable (e.g. if you don't want to modify ~/.profile):
#     NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=~/.npm-global

# npm install --global gulp-cli
